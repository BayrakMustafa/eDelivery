	<p>
	The different eDelivery concepts of the Large Scale Pilot Projects currently are subject to convergence activities; 
	consolidation and alignment of the different approaches will be one major task of the e-SENS LSP planned to
	be launched beginning of 2013.<br/> <br/>
	For SPOCS eDelivery, following enhancements where already discussed during project lifetime:<br></br>
				<ul>
					<li>Placement of Gateway meta-data (actually carried in SPOCS TL extension)in a 
					separate file metadata.xml. Presumably a converged solution will adopt the PEPPOL concept 
					"Service Metadata Publisher" (SMP)"Service Metadata Locator" (SML) for this functionality. 
					The future converged solution should be transparent for adapters to national solutions.</li>
					<li>Validiation of authentication level as required by targeted eDelivery system 
					against the one provided by the Sender of a message.</li>
					<li>Isolation of Evidence generation and Evidence validation in separate trusted function modules
					or even service nodes, to be activatable from any eDelivery infrastructure component via a
					standardized interface</li>
					<li>Same for SAML Sender Vouches Token</li>
					<li>Enhanced generalized stylesheets for visualization of Evidences and SAMl Tokens, to be used by
					national solutions for convenience.
					</li>
	
				</ul>
	Each of this function blocks needs a detailed concept and should fit in the more generalized architecture as 
	envisaged by e-SENS. Thus, the realization was postponed from the SPOCS to the e-SENS LSP.
